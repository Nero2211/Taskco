C# Windows Desktop Application

My first project in college when I joined the computing course.
The project itself is based around a self service check out system (often found in large super markets i.e. Tesco, Morrisons and many more).

This desktop application works in conjunction with a barcode scanner technology which queries the database (localhost) and retrieves the items and add it onto the system.
